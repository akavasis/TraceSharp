# TraceSharp - a C# path-tracer
## About
This project is to demonstrate a wide variety of software engineering skills.
I've tried my best to show the kind of code I would write in a production environment, including unit tests.

The project itself isn't meant to be used a production-grade renderer. It's just a fun and interesting way for me to show my skills.
